				<section>Quick History on GNOME Engagement</section>
				<section>
          <h2> GNOME Journal </h2>
        <ul>
          <li> Started in 2000 </li>
          <li> The idea was to create engaging content on what GNOME was doing </li>
          <li> Was hard because as we are leaning, nobody really knew what goes into a release! </li>
          <li> IRC channel - #gnome-journal </li>
          <li> fun facts: Working on GNOME Journal - spawned the yelp help browser, and gnome-doc-utils, more than half the people working on gnome journal ended up on the Canonical community team. </li>
         </ul>
        </section>
        <section> 
          <h2>Marketing</h2>
        GNOME Journal went away after 2003 or 2004. The channel was renamed to #marketing.
        <ul>
          <li> We basically talked about how to engage with audiences, and show off GNOME tech. </li>
          <li> It wasn't super active. </li>
          <li> During the prime GNOME days when GNOME had a lot of money from consulting companies, Intel and Nokia </li>
        </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Engagement</h2>
          Marketing was renamed to engagement after 2011 when GNOME 3 was released. The idea was that we had to deal with a lot of fall out from that release. It was crazy times. So, we wanted to make sure that we were in control of the messaging.
          <ul>
            <li> More engagement at conferences </li>
            <li> Swag showing off the brand </li>
            <li> Control of the GNOME irc channels on freenode.</li>
            <li> Took over existing /r/gnome Reddit channel </li>
            <li> Actively engaging about GNOME 3 in various social media areas. </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Engagement has been successful</h2>
          Engagement was always about engaging with the community because of hostility and was focused on externally.

          Today, we have largely been successful in the messaging thanks to improvements to GNOME and a new generation of users who understand the GNOME workflow. ðŸŽ‰
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>A new era of engagement</h2>

          Today, I'd like talk about new challenges and how we want to re-organize engaegment to do that.
